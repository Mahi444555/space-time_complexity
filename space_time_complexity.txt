Time complexity and space complexity
1)time complexity: 
* Time complexity is depends on the program logic or 
  how many loops are written in program i.e. no of iterations
   -for single loop : 
    eg:	for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)
		cout<<i;
	so, above loop executes n times i.e. 1<=5,2<=5,3<=5,4<=5,5<=5 only 
		i.e. n times
	= so time complexity for single loop is : o(n)


   -nested loop or double loop
    eg: for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)
	{
	   for(int j=1;j<=n;j++)
		{
			cout<<j;
		} 
	}
	  so, above code having nested loop it will executes n*n times i.e. n^2 times i.e.
		for i=1 : j loop executes 5 times 1 2 3 4 5 
		    i=2 : j loop executes 5 times 1 2 3 4 5 
		    i=3 : j loop executes 5 times 1 2 3 4 5
                    i=4 : j loop executes 5 times 1 2 3 4 5	
		    i=5 : j loop executes 5 times 1 2 3 4 5   
	 So, total number of executions are 25 times i.e.  n*n 

	= so time complexity for nested loop is : o(n*n) or o(n-square)

* There are 3 types of notation
	case	              symbol 

 1. worst case : big of oh  i.e. 'O'
 2. best case  : omega      i.e. 'Ω' 
 3. avg  case  : Thita      i.e. 'θ'


* space complexity : space complexity is depends on the number of variables which we used in program 
			and also their datatypes calculate that it will give you space complexity of program
		  : space complexity of program is always constant after program is done it dosen't change by
		    number of inputs form user i.e. 'n'

	eg:#include<iostream>
	   using namespace std;
	   int main()
	    {
	       int a=10;		//first variable is int a 
	       int b=20;		//second variable is int b
	       int sum;			//third  variable is int sum    so all are integer type.
	    
		sum = a+b; 
		cout<<"sum is: "<<sum;	

	    } 
         : total are three variables a, b  & sum :  all are integer so integer having 4 bytes 
		i.e. int a having 4 bytes	
                     int b having 4 bytes
		     int c having 4 bytes    : so, total is 4+4+4 is 12 bytes of memory will acquired by program
	so, space complexity is: 12 bytes

	note: it depends on compiler to compiler integer having 2 byte or 4 bytes by defaultly


*space complexity depends on or directly related  to the number of vaeriables are used in program 
*time complexity depends on the logic you implemented or how many loops you uesd.
